# Technologies Used
<ul>
<li>Used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Node to build the website.
<li>Used Screencastify to record the walkthrough video.
</ul>
<br>
<br>

# Usage
Users can run 'npm test' to see the tests passing or failing.
Users can run 'node index.js' to begin creating their team profile.
<br>
<br>

# User Story
<ul>
<li>As a user I want to create a team profile quickly
<li>WHEN I run 'node index.js' I will be asked a series of questions about the team manager.
<li>THEN I will be able to navigate to answer questions about team engineers or interns.
<li>WHEN I have finished answering all the questions,
<li>THEN I can navigte to 'End Application'.
<li>WHEN I choose to end the application,
<li>THEN an index.html file will be created in the /dist file.
<li>WHEN I open the HTML file in the browser,
<li>THEN I will see a Team Profile page with my team's information correctly organized.
</ul>
<br>
<br>

# Challenges
<ul>
<li>Running the tests produced fails for some files, which is actually a good thing because it pointed out issues that needed to be debugged. 
</ul>
<br>
